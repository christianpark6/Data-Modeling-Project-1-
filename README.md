# Data-Modeling-Project-1-
Conducted Data Analysis on Congress Use of Social Media dataset by The Pew Research Center. The purpose of the experiment was to create a predictive/explanatory model that would dive into the relationship between selected predictors and the Total Max Amount of Followers on these social media platforms. I used many different approaches to creating my final model which included using an Automated Stepwise Forward Selection process looking at AIC and a Best Subsets Regression looking at BIC. I also looked at things like the summary statistics of the models, a matrix to view the relationship between certain predictors, VIF, and residual plots.
